# YOLO Model Analysis Summary - Stuck at 0.2 Score

## 🔍 What I Found

### Current Model Performance
- **Total Detections**: 31,947 across 150 images
- **Average per Image**: 213 detections
- **Detection Range**: 32-300 per image
- **Problem**: 52 images hitting the 300 detection cap!

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue #1: Only One Class Detected ⚠️
**Problem**: All 31,947 detections are "individual_tree"
- NO "group_of_trees" detected at all
- This is likely costing you significant points

**Why This Happens**:
- Ground truth data shows "unknown" category (potential data loading issue)
- Model may not be learning class distinction properly
- Class imbalance in training data

**How to Fix**:
1. Check your training data labels have both classes
2. Look at `yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt` - each should have class IDs 0 and 1
3. The model needs to see examples of both classes during training

#### Issue #2: Hitting Max Detection Limit
**Problem**: 52 images have exactly 300 detections
- YOLO has default max_det=300
- You're likely missing detections due to this cap

**How to Fix**:
```python
# In your inference script, change:
results = self.model.predict(
    source=str(image_path),
    conf=confidence_threshold,
    iou=iou_threshold,
    max_det=1000,  # ADD THIS LINE
    save=False,
    verbose=False
)
```

#### Issue #3: Threshold Too Low
**Problem**: conf=0.1 is very aggressive
- Leads to many false positives
- 31,947 detections seems excessive

**Recommended Thresholds**:
```python
confidence_threshold = 0.25  # Higher to reduce false positives
iou_threshold = 0.7          # Higher for better NMS
```

## 📊 Visualizations Created

I created visualizations in `yolo_visualizations/` folder:

### 1. Statistics (`yolo_visualizations/statistics/`)
- `detections_histogram.png` - Shows detection distribution per image
- `category_distribution.png` - Shows you're only detecting one class
- `summary_statistics.txt` - Detailed numerical summary

### 2. Sample Predictions (`yolo_visualizations/sample_predictions/`)
- 9 sample images showing few, median, and many detections
- Visual representation of what YOLO is detecting
- Green polygons = individual trees
- Yellow would be tree groups (but none detected)

### 3. Analysis Report
- `yolo_visualizations/improvement_report.txt` - Full detailed report

## 🎯 Action Plan to Improve from 0.2

### Priority 1: Fix Class Detection (CRITICAL)
This is probably why you're stuck at 0.2!

**Step 1: Verify Training Labels**
```bash
# Check if labels have both classes
head -20 yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt
```

Look for lines starting with `0` (individual_tree) and `1` (group_of_trees)

**Step 2: Check Data Distribution**
```bash
# Count class occurrences
grep -c "^0 " yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt | wc -l
grep -c "^1 " yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt | wc -l
```

**Step 3: If Imbalanced, Retrain with Weighted Loss**
Modify `train_yolo.py`:
```python
model = YOLO('yolov8m-seg.pt')  # Use medium model (better than nano)
results = model.train(
    data='yolo_dataset/data.yaml',
    epochs=50,  # Train longer
    batch=4,
    imgsz=640,
    device='cpu',
    patience=10,
    save=True,
    project='runs/segment',
    name='tree_segmentation_improved',
    # Add class weights if needed
)
```

### Priority 2: Adjust Inference Thresholds

**Quick Fix - Update `inference_yolo.py`:**

```python
# Around line 234-235, change:
confidence_threshold = 0.25   # Increase from 0.1
iou_threshold = 0.7           # Increase from 0.6

# Around line 123, add max_det:
results = self.model.predict(
    source=str(image_path),
    conf=confidence_threshold,
    iou=iou_threshold,
    max_det=1000,  # ADD THIS
    save=False,
    verbose=False
)
```

Then re-run:
```bash
python3 inference_yolo.py
```

### Priority 3: Train Longer with Better Model

Current: 10 epochs with yolov8n-seg (nano)
Recommended: 50+ epochs with yolov8m-seg (medium)

**Why**: 
- Nano model might be too small for this complex task
- 10 epochs is likely insufficient for convergence
- Medium model has more capacity to learn both classes

**Update `train_yolo.py`:**
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

def main():
    # Use MEDIUM model instead of nano
    model = YOLO('yolov8m-seg.pt')
    
    results = model.train(
        data='yolo_dataset/data.yaml',
        epochs=50,        # Increase from 10
        batch=4,          # Reduce if memory issues
        imgsz=640,
        device='cpu',
        patience=15,      # Early stopping
        save=True,
        project='runs/segment',
        name='tree_segmentation_medium_50ep',
        
        # Enhanced augmentation
        degrees=15,       # Rotation
        translate=0.1,    # Translation
        scale=0.5,        # Scaling
        fliplr=0.5,       # Horizontal flip
        mosaic=1.0,       # Mosaic augmentation
        mixup=0.1,        # Mixup augmentation
    )
    
    print(f"Training completed!")
    print(f"Best model saved at: {results.save_dir}/weights/best.pt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Priority 4: Validate Your Changes

After each change, run:
```bash
# Re-run inference
python3 inference_yolo.py

# Re-analyze
python3 analyze_for_improvement.py

# Check class distribution
python3 -c "
import json
data = json.load(open('optimized_predictions.json'))
classes = {}
for img in data['images']:
    for ann in img['annotations']:
        c = ann['class']
        classes[c] = classes.get(c, 0) + 1
print('Class distribution:', classes)
"
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

| Change | Expected Impact | Score Boost |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Fix class detection | HIGH | +0.3-0.5 |
| Adjust thresholds | MEDIUM | +0.1-0.2 |
| Train longer/better | MEDIUM | +0.1-0.3 |
| Remove max_det cap | LOW | +0.05-0.1 |

**Realistic Target**: 0.5-0.7 with all fixes applied

## 🔧 Quick Commands to Run Now

```bash
# 1. Check current class distribution in predictions
python3 -c "
import json
data = json.load(open('optimized_predictions.json'))
classes = {}
for img in data['images']:
    for ann in img['annotations']:
        c = ann['class']
        classes[c] = classes.get(c, 0) + 1
print('Classes found:', classes)
"

# 2. Check training labels have both classes
head -5 yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt | grep "^0 " | head -3
head -5 yolo_dataset/train/labels/*.txt | grep "^1 " | head -3

# 3. Quick threshold test
# Edit inference_yolo.py lines 234-235 to use conf=0.25, iou=0.7
# Then run:
python3 inference_yolo.py

# 4. Compare results
python3 analyze_for_improvement.py
```

## 🎨 Understanding the Visualizations

Open these files to see what your model is doing:

1. **Detection Histogram** (`statistics/detections_histogram.png`)
   - Shows most images have 150-250 detections
   - Many images hitting 300 cap (red warning sign)

2. **Category Distribution** (`statistics/category_distribution.png`)
   - Should show TWO bars (individual + group)
   - Currently shows ONE bar (only individual)
   - **This is your main problem!**

3. **Sample Images** (`sample_predictions/*.png`)
   - Look at the green polygons
   - Are they detecting actual trees?
   - Are groups of trees being marked as individual?

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Class Detection is Critical**: Getting both classes working could improve score by 0.3-0.5 alone
2. **Max Detection Cap**: You're losing detections on 52 images
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Current settings (0.1, 0.6) may be too permissive
4. **Model Size**: Consider yolov8m-seg instead of yolov8n-seg
5. **Training Duration**: 10 epochs is likely insufficient

## 🚀 Start Here

**Most Important First Step**:
```bash
# Check if your training data has both classes
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
labels_dir = Path('yolo_dataset/train/labels')
class_0 = 0
class_1 = 0
for label_file in labels_dir.glob('*.txt'):
    with open(label_file) as f:
        for line in f:
            if line.strip():
                cls = int(line.split()[0])
                if cls == 0:
                    class_0 += 1
                elif cls == 1:
                    class_1 += 1
print(f'Class 0 (individual_tree): {class_0}')
print(f'Class 1 (group_of_trees): {class_1}')
print(f'Ratio: {class_0/class_1 if class_1 > 0 else \"No class 1!\"}')
"
```

If this shows **no class 1**, that's your problem! The model never learned about tree groups.

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Run the class distribution check above
2. Look at the visualization images
3. Start with Priority 1 (fix class detection)
4. Re-run inference with new thresholds (Priority 2)
5. Consider retraining with better settings (Priority 3)

Good luck! The visualizations should help you see exactly what's happening. 🌳
